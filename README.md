# Overview

<!-- {Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.} -->

<!-- {Provide a description the web app that you wrote. Describe how to start a test server on your computer and what website to open up to see the first page of the app.} -->
<!-- {Describe your purpose for writing this software.} -->
A very basic web application that has math flashcards. The website is using Django as a framework. The flashcard website generates web pages dynamically on heroku.  This website will help teach children math facts. The website calls python code when a request in made through the web app. The Python code parses the request and prepares a response. The website performs calculations for the math flashcards. The response is created by the a Python function and automatically sent back to the framework.
